# GameUsersApi
A Python Flask sample API to add a user/password to a DB.

This is a sample code that I wrote some time back to learn how Flask works. I needed a way to store user names/passwords
and scores for a game I was working on.

The code is very basic and only has the 'Add user' functionality, but it demonstrates how to send user names/passwords to an 
API and how to hash/salt the password before storing it in the DB.

I hope it is useful to someone.
